/etc/hosts = local DNS mapping
/etc/nswitch.conf = dictates the order of how linux resolves names

systemctl status systemd-resolved = check DNS status
resolvctl status = shows current dns servers
sudo resolvectl dns enp0s3 1.1.1.1 8.8.8.8 = temporarily setting a dns servers

/etc/resolv.conf is a symlink to /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf


ip link
sudo ip link set $NIC up/down = sets the link up or down
ip link show $NIC = shows status of interface

Temporary routes are added using ip route add/Delete
Persistent routes are added via netplan
routes:
    - to: ip
      via: gateway


firewalld (RHEL/CentOS version of UFW)
firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
firewall-cmd --add-port=8080/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
firewall-cmd --list-all


NIC bonding (combing interfaces)
cat /proc/net/bonding/bond0 = check bonded interfaces
ip link show bond0 = check status


Common Fixes

Interface up but no IP
sudo dhclient -v $NIC

DNS works for IPs but not hostnames (missing dns servers)

No default route
sudo ip route add default via $GATEWAY 

Route exist but gateway unreachable 
sudo ip neigh flush dev $NIC

Understanding Permissions
-rwxr-xr--
[1] the file type ( - )
[2-4] user permissions ( rwx ) 
[5-7] group permissions ( r-x )
[8-10] other/world permissions (r--)

r = read
w = write
x = execute
- = no permissions

chmod is used to give permissions
u is for user
g is for group
o is for other
+ / - is used to determine whether adding or removing permissions

Examples
chmod u+x file.sh : this gives the user execute permissions to file.sh
chmod g-w file.sh : this removes write permissions to file.sh for a group

Number formatting
r = 4
w = 2
x = 1
- = 0

chmod 755 file.sh = rwxr-xr-xr
xxx-xxx-xxx

User & Group Ownership
groupadd [options] groupname
sudo usermod -aG groupname username

sudo chown admin:admin file.txt : sets both user and group
sudo chgrp developers file.txt : sets just group
-R can be used to recursively set permissions

Sticky Bit 1(xxx)
chmod 1777 /some/dir = only the owner of files can delete files but everyone can read

Setuid (for files only)
Makes it so that when a file is executed its ran as the owner of the file
4 is used to do this
chmod 4755 file (see the 4)

Setgid (on both files and directories)
On files it'll run as the files group (permissions of the group)
used a 2 to run this
chmod 2755 file (see the 2)
If ran on directories it makes any file in that directory inherit that group

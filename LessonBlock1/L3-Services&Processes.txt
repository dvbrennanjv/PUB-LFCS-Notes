A service is a daemon managed by systemd (apache, ssh, docker, etc)

systemctl status $service - to check a service
sudo systemctl start/stop $service - to stop and start a service
restart - to restart a service
reload - reloads the config without restarting

sudo systemctl mask/unmask $service

journalctl -u $service - shows all logs for a service
-b : to show current boot
